# Create a final dataframe with NAs in the Spotify info where there was no info

# For example, for some reason, if I use the API to look for "BjÃ¶rk", it does not find it. But if I look for "Bjork" it does.
# I think I should have removed tildes first. But it's too late now.
# Another example is "Beck". If I use searchArtist("Beck", keys) the first option is "Becky G", and the third option is "Beck".
# The problem here is that my code only checked for the firt option, and if it didn not match, it assigns an NA.
# I should have searched for the best matching string. But again, too late now, I won't do it again.
